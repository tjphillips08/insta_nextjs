## Technologies Used ##

This application was built with Next.JS. User authentication was built using Auth0 and styling was built using TailwindCSS and HeadlessUI. I really branched out on this project to use frameworks and languages that I have not had much experience. I wanted to challenge myself along with showing my ability to learn and grasp new technologies quickly.
